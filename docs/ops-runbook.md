# StaticFlow Operations Runbook

This document contains production deployment details, infrastructure configuration,
and emergency recovery procedures extracted from the agent guide. For day-to-day
development and coding guidance, see `CLAUDE.md` (or `AGENTS.md`).

## GCP Production Topology

Current source-of-truth production facts verified on 2026-05-02:
- Caddy config path: `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`.
- Active Caddy site block proxies LLM paths to `127.0.0.1:19080` and all
  other paths to `127.0.0.1:39080`.
- Server-side pb-mapper client systemd unit:
  `pb-mapper-client-cli@sf-backend.service`.
- Server-side pb-mapper client env file:
  `/etc/pb-mapper/client-cli/sf-backend.env`.
- Current pb-mapper client settings are read from the private server-side env:
  - `PB_SERVER=<configured relay address>`
  - `SERVICE_KEY=sf-backend`
  - `LOCAL_ADDR=127.0.0.1:39080`
- Server-side pb-mapper server systemd unit: `pb-mapper-server.service`.
- Cloud `llm-access` API systemd unit: `llm-access.service`, serving
  provider/admin compatibility traffic on `127.0.0.1:19080`.
- Target cloud `llm-access` usage worker systemd unit:
  `llm-access-usage-worker.service`, serving DuckDB-backed usage queries on
  `127.0.0.1:19081`.
- Cloud JuiceFS mount service: `juicefs-llm-access.service`, mounting
  `/mnt/llm-access`.
- Cloud-to-local back-link unit:
  `pb-mapper-server-cli@llm-access.service`, registering `127.0.0.1:19080` as
  pb-mapper key `llm-access`.

## Standard Tier Ingress Trial (Rejected)

Standard Tier ingress trial on 2026-05-03:
- A temporary Standard Tier front door was tested as a TCP pass-through for
  `80`, `443`, and the configured pb-mapper relay port.
- The trial was rejected because the Standard Tier route from the local network
  showed much higher latency and packet loss than the existing Premium Tier
  path.
- The temporary VM and static IP were deleted on 2026-05-03. Do not use the
  trial endpoint for production or rollback; historical endpoint values belong
  only in private notes, not this repository.

## GCP / Valkey / JuiceFS Configuration

Current GCP / Valkey / JuiceFS facts verified on 2026-05-02. Concrete host,
user, key, bucket, account, and metadata endpoint values are stored in ignored
private env files, not in tracked docs.

- Local private cloud-release config is:
  `.local/llm-access-cloud-release.env`. Copy
  `conf/llm-access-cloud-release.env.example` when bootstrapping a new checkout.
- GCP SSH login from this workstation uses variables from that file:
  ```bash
  set -a
  source .local/llm-access-cloud-release.env
  set +a
  ssh -i "$GCP_SSH_KEY" -o IdentitiesOnly=yes "$GCP_DEST"
  ```
  If `GCP_DEST` is unset, build it from `GCP_USER@$GCP_HOST`.
- The GCP machine has FUSE available (`/dev/fuse`) and `fusermount3`; the
  JuiceFS binary path is deployment-specific and should be read from the
  private host configuration.
- R2 bucket/account/endpoint values for llm-access JuiceFS storage live in the
  private JuiceFS env below. Do not commit R2 access keys or endpoint/account
  identifiers.
- Local private JuiceFS config is:
  `.local/common/juicefs/llm-access.env`. This file is intentionally ignored by
  git through the `.local/` rule, must stay mode `0600`, and contains all
  JuiceFS/R2/Valkey variables needed for one-command sourcing:
  ```bash
  set -a
  source .local/common/juicefs/llm-access.env
  set +a
  ```
- The same config was copied to the GCP host at
  `~/.config/staticflow/llm-access-juicefs.env`, also mode `0600`.

## Valkey Metadata

- Valkey metadata host/login are deployment secrets; load them from the private
  JuiceFS/cloud env before connecting:
  ```bash
  set -a
  source .local/common/juicefs/llm-access.env
  set +a
  ssh "$VALKEY_SSH_TARGET"
  ```
  Valkey runs as `valkey-16379.service`, listens on port `16379`, and uses:
  - config: `/etc/valkey/valkey-16379.conf`
  - ACL file: `/etc/valkey/valkey-16379.acl`
  - CLI: `/opt/valkey/current/bin/valkey-cli`
  - data dir: `/var/lib/valkey`
  - AOF: enabled, `appendfsync everysec`
  - max memory policy: `noeviction`
- A dedicated Valkey ACL user `juicefs` exists for JuiceFS metadata. Do not
  print or commit the ACL password; use the ignored env file above.
- Reserved Valkey DBs for JuiceFS metadata:
  - production DB: configured in the ignored JuiceFS env
  - temporary validation DB: configured in the ignored JuiceFS env when needed
- GCP validation already proved:
  - R2 object put/get/head/delete through JuiceFS `objbench` works from GCP.
  - JuiceFS format/mount/write/read/sha256/umount works on the temporary
    validation DB.
  - Valkey metadata ping from GCP was about 1-2 ms.
- Cloudflare R2 is usable for normal JuiceFS mount read/write, but its S3
  `ListObjects` behavior is not fully ordered. Avoid relying on JuiceFS
  maintenance commands that need complete ordered object listing, especially
  `gc`, `fsck`, `sync`, and `destroy`, unless separately tested for this R2
  bucket and accepted for the operation.

## Cloud llm-access Deployment Shape

- `llm-access` must be a single-writer service for its SQLite, DuckDB, and auth
  JSON files. Do not run local and cloud `llm-access` processes that both write
  the same JuiceFS-mounted state tree.
- The production JuiceFS mount point is `/mnt/llm-access`; llm-access should
  use:
  - state root: `/mnt/llm-access`
  - SQLite control DB: `/mnt/llm-access/control/llm-access.sqlite3`
  - hot local usage journal dir: `/var/lib/staticflow/llm-access/usage-journal`
  - local active DuckDB dir: `/var/lib/staticflow/llm-access/analytics-active`
  - archived immutable DuckDB segments:
    `/mnt/llm-access/analytics/segments`
  - DuckDB segment catalog: `/mnt/llm-access/analytics/catalog`
  - heavy usage detail object prefix: direct R2 object storage configured by
    `LLM_ACCESS_USAGE_DETAILS_OBJECT_STORE_URL`
  - email credentials: `/mnt/llm-access/config/email_accounts.json`
  - API bind address: `127.0.0.1:19080`
  - usage worker bind address: `127.0.0.1:19081`
- Gmail notification credentials must live on JuiceFS, not VM-local `/etc`.
  `llm-access.service` should set
  `EMAIL_ACCOUNTS_FILE=/mnt/llm-access/config/email_accounts.json`; keep the
  file mode `0600` and do not log credential contents.
- Service ownership after the usage split:
  - `llm-access.service`: provider traffic, SQLite control/rollups, account
    status refreshers, and compact local usage journal production.
  - `llm-access-usage-worker.service`: journal consumption, tiered DuckDB
    summary writes, direct usage-detail object uploads, worker progress state,
    and legacy admin usage list/detail query routes on the worker port.
- The live worker environment must include direct object-store credentials for
  usage details. At minimum:
  - `LLM_ACCESS_USAGE_DETAILS_OBJECT_STORE_URL`
  - `R2_ENDPOINT`
  - `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  If these are missing, the worker will fall back to metadata credentials and
  detail uploads will fail even though the service still starts.
- Live GCP `llm-access.service` currently runs as the non-root `ts_user`
  service user. The checked-in template still uses a dedicated `llm-access`
  user for fresh deployments; either is acceptable if file ownership, FUSE
  permissions, and readiness checks are consistent.
- Current GCP systemd units verified on 2026-05-13:
  - `juicefs-llm-access.service`: mounts `/mnt/llm-access`
  - `llm-access.service`: serves `127.0.0.1:19080`
    and proxies legacy admin usage routes to the worker query port
  - `pb-mapper-server-cli@llm-access.service`: registers cloud
    `127.0.0.1:19080` as pb-mapper key `llm-access`
- The usage-journal split adds `llm-access-usage-worker.service`, serving
  `127.0.0.1:19081`, consuming sealed journal files, and serving DuckDB-backed
  usage queries.
- Current GCP llm-access logs:
  - systemd journal: `sudo journalctl -u llm-access.service -f`
  - usage worker journal:
    `sudo journalctl -u llm-access-usage-worker.service -f`
  - runtime app logs:
    `/var/log/staticflow-runtime/llm-access/app/current.*.log`
  - runtime access logs:
    `/var/log/staticflow-runtime/llm-access/access/current.*.log`
  - JuiceFS mount logs:
    `sudo journalctl -u juicefs-llm-access.service -f`; the configured
    `/var/log/juicefs/llm-access.log` may not receive every active-run line
    because the mount process is systemd-supervised.
  Runtime logs rotate hourly and retain the latest 4 files per stream.
- Current GCP JuiceFS local cache uses `/var/cache/juicefs/llm-access`. Keep
  the cache on the VM local ext4 disk, not inside `/mnt/llm-access`. The
  systemd mount template sets `cache-size=40960` (MiB) so hot reads do not
  constantly round-trip to R2.

## GCP Memory Guard (2c8g VM)

- `/swapfile` and `/swapfile-llm-extra` are each 2 GiB emergency swap files,
  enabled through `/etc/fstab`; host swap total is 4 GiB.
- `/etc/sysctl.d/99-staticflow-memory-guard.conf` sets `vm.swappiness=10`.
- `llm-access.service` has `MemoryHigh=3584M`, `MemoryMax=4096M`,
  `MemorySwapMax=1024M`, `TasksMax=256`, and `OOMPolicy=kill`.
- `llm-access-usage-worker.service` should carry the DuckDB memory budget after
  the split. Start with `MemoryHigh=2200M`, `MemoryMax=3072M`,
  `MemorySwapMax=1024M`, `TasksMax=128`, and `OOMPolicy=kill`; keep API and
  worker limits independent so a DuckDB scan cannot kill provider traffic.
- `juicefs-llm-access.service` has `MemoryHigh=1800M`,
  `MemoryMax=2560M`, `MemorySwapMax=0`, `TasksMax=256`, and
  `OOMPolicy=kill`.
These limits are meant to kill/restart the offending service before the whole
VM becomes unreachable. Do not raise `MemoryMax` casually on 8 GiB RAM; keep
extra swap as an emergency buffer, not as normal working memory.

## llm-access Usage Analytics

- Current llm-access usage analytics should run in tiered DuckDB mode: only the
  active mutable DuckDB file lives on local VM block storage; JuiceFS/R2 stores
  immutable archived segment files plus the low-frequency segment catalog. Do
  not point a live writer at `/mnt/llm-access/analytics/usage.duckdb` as a
  mutable all-history DuckDB file.
- Heavy per-event detail payloads are not part of the hot DuckDB write path
  anymore. The worker writes summary facts into tiered DuckDB, but writes
  detail payloads as compressed JSON objects directly to R2. This keeps
  checkpoint/rollover memory bounded by summary analytics instead of full
  request bodies.
- The API process no longer writes usage events directly into DuckDB. It first
  commits SQLite rollups, then appends compact diagnostic usage events to
  `/var/lib/staticflow/llm-access/usage-journal`. The separate usage worker consumes sealed
  journal files in batches, imports them into tiered DuckDB, records worker
  progress in `consumer-state.sqlite3`, and deletes consumed journal files.
- Journal file rollover is controlled by both size and age. Retention is
  intentionally lossy for old unconsumed diagnostics: SQLite rollups remain the
  source of truth for quota/account accounting, while journal events are for
  detailed troubleshooting.
- Legacy usage query paths remain compatible. The public/API service keeps the
  old `/admin/llm-gateway/usage*` and `/admin/kiro-gateway/usage*` routes for
  auth and compatibility, but proxies those queries to
  `usage_query_base_url` (`http://127.0.0.1:19081` by default).
- The completed migration model is:
  1. Production `llm-access` state lives under `/mnt/llm-access` and the local
     VM active DuckDB directory described above.
  2. Only cloud `llm-access.service` writes SQLite rollups and local journal
     files; only `llm-access-usage-worker.service` writes tiered DuckDB.
  3. Cloud Caddy owns the public LLM route split and sends LLM paths directly
     to `127.0.0.1:19080`.
  4. Local StaticFlow reaches cloud `llm-access` through the local
     `127.0.0.1:19182` pb-mapper subscription or through the public same-origin
     path; it must not mount/write the JuiceFS state directly.

## llm-access Startup and Sandboxing Constraints

- Startup must be gated on the JuiceFS mount and expected state files. If
  `llm-access` starts before `/mnt/llm-access` is really mounted, it can
  initialize an empty local directory and make production state appear missing.
  The GCP service should install `/usr/local/bin/staticflow-wait-llm-access-state`
  and run it as `ExecStartPre` for `llm-access.service`; if JuiceFS is managed
  as a plain `.service`, add an `ExecStartPost` mountpoint gate there too so
  systemd does not mark the mount ready before FUSE has actually attached.
- Do not use systemd path sandboxing directives such as `ProtectSystem=`,
  `ReadWritePaths=`, or `PrivateTmp=` on the GCP `llm-access.service` while
  `/mnt/llm-access` is a JuiceFS FUSE mount with `default_permissions`. This
  combination can fail before the service starts with
  `status=226/NAMESPACE` and `Failed to set up mount namespacing:
  /mnt/llm-access: Permission denied`. Rely on the non-root service user,
  directory ownership, and the readiness script instead.

## llm-access Admin API Constraints

- Admin usage APIs are compatibility proxies to the usage worker. Broad
  diagnostics should still avoid large pages or full-table scans: DuckDB scan
  buffers now affect `llm-access-usage-worker.service` rather than provider
  traffic, but the worker is still a production process. Online usage list
  endpoints must stay server-bounded and lightweight: max `limit` is 20, max
  `offset` is 200, and list responses must not read/return heavy diagnostic
  fields such as message content or routing diagnostics. The response `total`
  should still be the exact count for the active filter condition, including
  key/provider/time filters. Use the per-event detail endpoint by `event_id`
  when heavy fields are needed.

## Current Runtime Verification Snapshot

- Verified on GCP at `2026-05-13T20:22:32Z`.
- Effective live API unit:
  - service user: `ts_user`
  - bind: `127.0.0.1:19080`
  - current `ExecStart`: journal-only API process with
    `--usage-journal-dir ${LLM_ACCESS_USAGE_JOURNAL_DIR}`
  - effective `LLM_ACCESS_USAGE_JOURNAL_DIR`:
    `/var/lib/staticflow/llm-access/usage-journal`
- Effective live usage-worker unit:
  - service user: `ts_user`
  - bind: `127.0.0.1:19081`
  - current `ExecStart`: worker process with local journal root,
    local active DuckDB dir, JuiceFS archive/catalog dirs, and direct R2 usage
    detail object uploads
  - cgroup guard observed live:
    `MemoryHigh=2200M`, `MemoryMax=3072M`, `MemorySwapMax=1024M`
- Live health checks that should all pass:
  ```bash
  curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:19080/healthz
  curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:19081/admin/llm-access/usage-worker/status
  curl -fsS -H 'Host: localhost' http://127.0.0.1:19080/admin/llm-access/usage-journal/status
  systemctl show llm-access.service -p ActiveState -p SubState -p ExecStart -p Environment --no-pager
  systemctl show llm-access-usage-worker.service -p ActiveState -p SubState -p ExecStart -p Environment --no-pager
  ```
- Healthy interpretation of the combined journal status:
  - `journal_root` must be `/var/lib/staticflow/llm-access/usage-journal`
  - `usage_query_base_url` must be `http://127.0.0.1:19081`
  - `sealed_file_count == 0` with `worker.state == idle` means the producer is
    only appending to the current open journal file and there is nothing waiting
    to be consumed. This is healthy, not a stuck worker.
  - `active_file_sequence` and `active_file_bytes` should move over time while
    traffic exists.
- Current live snapshot on 2026-05-13 after the direct-R2 detail cutover showed:
  - API `/healthz`: `{"status":"ok","service":"llm-access"}`
  - worker status advancing in `state=importing`, `last_error=null`
  - worker environment includes `LLM_ACCESS_USAGE_DETAILS_OBJECT_STORE_URL`,
    `R2_ENDPOINT`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

## Known Residuals After Journal-Root Cutover

- Historical files still exist under `/mnt/llm-access/usage-journal`. Current
  live units no longer point there, so treat that tree as stale forensic data,
  not the active producer/consumer root.
- The live GCP API unit still has an older drop-in
  `/etc/systemd/system/llm-access.service.d/zz-usage-journal-split.conf` that
  sets `LLM_ACCESS_USAGE_JOURNAL_DIR=/mnt/llm-access/usage-journal`. The
  effective local-root override currently comes from a later-sorting drop-in
  `/etc/systemd/system/llm-access.service.d/zzz-usage-journal-local.conf`.
  If that later drop-in is removed or renamed earlier alphabetically, the API
  process will silently fall back to the JuiceFS journal root again.
- The worker unit currently uses
  `/etc/systemd/system/llm-access-usage-worker.service.d/zzz-usage-journal-local.conf`
  for the same local journal override.
- One historical pending segment currently remains under
  `/var/lib/staticflow/llm-access/analytics-active/pending/` and has logged:
  `Conversion Error: Could not convert string 'unknown' to INT64 when casting from source column client_ip`.
  This is a historical archive-compaction residue. It did not break current API
  health or the new journal path on 2026-05-07, but it means the archive lane
  is not fully clean.
- The live SQLite runtime config on 2026-05-07 used
  `duckdb_usage_memory_limit_mib=2048` and
  `duckdb_usage_checkpoint_threshold_mib=16`. Lowering the DuckDB memory limit
  back to `1024` reproduced checkpoint OOM inside DuckDB before the systemd
  `MemoryMax=3072M` cgroup guard was reached.

## Cloud Release and Post-Release Verification

- Local release preparation from this checkout:
  ```bash
  export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/mnt/wsl/data4tb/static-flow-data/cargo-target/static_flow
  ./scripts/prepare_llm_access_cloud_release.sh
  ```
- Remote activation:
  ```bash
  set -a
  source .local/llm-access-cloud-release.env
  set +a
  ssh -i "$GCP_SSH_KEY" -o IdentitiesOnly=yes "$GCP_DEST" \
    '/home/ts_user/staticflow-llm-access-release/activate_llm_access_cloud_release.sh'
  ```
- Required post-release checks:
  ```bash
  curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:19080/healthz
  curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:19081/admin/llm-access/usage-worker/status
  curl -fsS -H 'Host: localhost' http://127.0.0.1:19080/admin/llm-access/usage-journal/status
  systemctl show llm-access.service -p ExecStart -p Environment --no-pager
  systemctl show llm-access-usage-worker.service -p ExecStart -p Environment --no-pager
  sudo journalctl -u llm-access.service -n 80 --no-pager -l
  sudo journalctl -u llm-access-usage-worker.service -n 80 --no-pager -l
  ```
- If the combined journal status reports the old mount path or the worker
  returns permission errors for `.../usage-journal/sealed`, check the live
  drop-in ordering and directory ownership first:
  - `/etc/systemd/system/llm-access.service.d/zzz-usage-journal-local.conf`
  - `/etc/systemd/system/llm-access-usage-worker.service.d/zzz-usage-journal-local.conf`
  - owner/group of `/var/lib/staticflow/llm-access/usage-journal`
- If the worker starts but `last_error` shows `169.254.169.254/latest/api/token`
  or other metadata-provider credential failures, check the live
  `/etc/llm-access/llm-access.env` first. That means the worker has
  `LLM_ACCESS_USAGE_DETAILS_OBJECT_STORE_URL` but is missing direct R2
  credentials, so `object_store` fell back to instance metadata auth.

## Emergency Recovery for Sudden Public Outage

Common trigger pattern: home network flap, ISP reconnect, hotspot fallback,
or other local-to-cloud path churn causes pb-mapper data forwarding to wedge
while systemd units still look "active".

Another trigger pattern is downstream relay latency on non-LLM routes that is
much higher than StaticFlow's own route timings. Treat that as a likely stale
or wedged cloud-side Caddy/pb-mapper connection state before changing
StaticFlow backend code. For Codex/Kiro/NewAPI LLM latency, check cloud
`llm-access.service` and its DuckDB/JuiceFS state first; that path no longer
traverses the local `sf-backend` pb-mapper tunnel.

If cloud-side `pb-mapper-client` reports
`Not valid key:sf-backend,valid keys:[...]`, or cloud-side
`pb-mapper-server` reports
`subcribe server conn key not exist, key:sf-backend`, or
`127.0.0.1:39080` never comes back to `LISTEN`, then the home/local machine
likely has not re-registered the `sf-backend` service. In that case, prompt
the user to re-register/restart the local home-side pb-mapper service first,
rather than repeatedly restarting only cloud-side services.

First-line recovery for these cloud relay path issues is to restart the
cloud-side Caddy and pb-mapper services together. This drops stale HTTP
keepalive/HTTP2/tunnel connections and is often the fastest way to restore
normal downstream latency:

```bash
set -a
source .local/llm-access-cloud-release.env
set +a
ssh -i "$GCP_SSH_KEY" -o IdentitiesOnly=yes "$GCP_DEST"
sudo systemctl restart caddy
sudo systemctl restart pb-mapper-server.service
sudo systemctl restart pb-mapper-client-cli@sf-backend.service
```

After restart, verify both the relay path and public path:

```bash
set -a
source .local/llm-access-cloud-release.env
set +a
ssh -i "$GCP_SSH_KEY" -o IdentitiesOnly=yes "$GCP_DEST" \
  "curl -o /dev/null -sS -w 'code=%{http_code} size=%{size_download} start=%{time_starttransfer} total=%{time_total}\n' \
    -H 'Host: ackingliu.top' http://127.0.0.1:39080/"

env -u https_proxy -u HTTPS_PROXY -u http_proxy -u HTTP_PROXY -u all_proxy -u ALL_PROXY \
  curl -o /dev/null -sS -w 'code=%{http_code} size=%{size_download} start=%{time_starttransfer} total=%{time_total}\n' \
  https://ackingliu.top/
```

If `sf-backend` was missing and has just been re-registered on the
home/local machine, restart cloud-side
`pb-mapper-client-cli@sf-backend.service` once more so it can re-subscribe to
the now-valid key.

If cloud-side restart does not restore service, continue debugging on the
home/local machine side of the tunnel before changing Caddy config.
