# StaticFlow Operations Runbook

This document contains production deployment details, infrastructure configuration,
and emergency recovery procedures extracted from the agent guide. For day-to-day
development and coding guidance, see `CLAUDE.md` (or `AGENTS.md`).

## GCP Production Topology

Current source-of-truth production facts verified on 2026-05-02:
- Caddy config path: `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`.
- Active Caddy site block proxies LLM paths to `127.0.0.1:19080` and all
  other paths to `127.0.0.1:39080`.
- Server-side pb-mapper client systemd unit:
  `pb-mapper-client-cli@sf-backend.service`.
- Server-side pb-mapper client env file:
  `/etc/pb-mapper/client-cli/sf-backend.env`.
- Current pb-mapper client settings are read from the private server-side env:
  - `PB_SERVER=<configured relay address>`
  - `SERVICE_KEY=sf-backend`
  - `LOCAL_ADDR=127.0.0.1:39080`
- Server-side pb-mapper server systemd unit: `pb-mapper-server.service`.
- Cloud `llm-access` API systemd unit: `llm-access.service`, serving
  provider/admin compatibility traffic on `127.0.0.1:19080`.
- Target cloud `llm-access` usage worker systemd unit:
  `llm-access-usage-worker.service`, serving DuckDB-backed usage queries on
  `127.0.0.1:19081`.
- Cloud JuiceFS mount service: `juicefs-llm-access.service`, mounting
  `/mnt/llm-access`.
- Cloud-to-local back-link unit:
  `pb-mapper-server-cli@llm-access.service`, registering `127.0.0.1:19080` as
  pb-mapper key `llm-access`.

## Standard Tier Ingress Trial (Rejected)

Standard Tier ingress trial on 2026-05-03:
- A temporary Standard Tier front door was tested as a TCP pass-through for
  `80`, `443`, and the configured pb-mapper relay port.
- The trial was rejected because the Standard Tier route from the local network
  showed much higher latency and packet loss than the existing Premium Tier
  path.
- The temporary VM and static IP were deleted on 2026-05-03. Do not use the
  trial endpoint for production or rollback; historical endpoint values belong
  only in private notes, not this repository.

## GCP / Valkey / JuiceFS Configuration

Current GCP / Valkey / JuiceFS facts verified on 2026-05-02. Concrete host,
user, key, bucket, account, and metadata endpoint values are stored in ignored
private env files, not in tracked docs.

- Local private cloud-release config is:
  `.local/llm-access-cloud-release.env`. Copy
  `conf/llm-access-cloud-release.env.example` when bootstrapping a new checkout.
- GCP SSH login from this workstation uses variables from that file:
  ```bash
  set -a
  source .local/llm-access-cloud-release.env
  set +a
  ssh -i "$GCP_SSH_KEY" -o IdentitiesOnly=yes "$GCP_DEST"
  ```
  If `GCP_DEST` is unset, build it from `GCP_USER@$GCP_HOST`.
- The GCP machine has FUSE available (`/dev/fuse`) and `fusermount3`; the
  JuiceFS binary path is deployment-specific and should be read from the
  private host configuration.
- R2 bucket/account/endpoint values for llm-access JuiceFS storage live in the
  private JuiceFS env below. Do not commit R2 access keys or endpoint/account
  identifiers.
- Local private JuiceFS config is:
  `.local/common/juicefs/llm-access.env`. This file is intentionally ignored by
  git through the `.local/` rule, must stay mode `0600`, and contains all
  JuiceFS/R2/Valkey variables needed for one-command sourcing:
  ```bash
  set -a
  source .local/common/juicefs/llm-access.env
  set +a
  ```
- The same config was copied to the GCP host at
  `~/.config/staticflow/llm-access-juicefs.env`, also mode `0600`.

## Valkey Metadata

- Valkey metadata host/login are deployment secrets; load them from the private
  JuiceFS/cloud env before connecting:
  ```bash
  set -a
  source .local/common/juicefs/llm-access.env
  set +a
  ssh "$VALKEY_SSH_TARGET"
  ```
  Valkey runs as `valkey-16379.service`, listens on port `16379`, and uses:
  - config: `/etc/valkey/valkey-16379.conf`
  - ACL file: `/etc/valkey/valkey-16379.acl`
  - CLI: `/opt/valkey/current/bin/valkey-cli`
  - data dir: `/var/lib/valkey`
  - AOF: enabled, `appendfsync everysec`
  - max memory policy: `noeviction`
- A dedicated Valkey ACL user `juicefs` exists for JuiceFS metadata. Do not
  print or commit the ACL password; use the ignored env file above.
- Reserved Valkey DBs for JuiceFS metadata:
  - production DB: configured in the ignored JuiceFS env
  - temporary validation DB: configured in the ignored JuiceFS env when needed
- GCP validation already proved:
  - R2 object put/get/head/delete through JuiceFS `objbench` works from GCP.
  - JuiceFS format/mount/write/read/sha256/umount works on the temporary
    validation DB.
  - Valkey metadata ping from GCP was about 1-2 ms.
- Cloudflare R2 is usable for normal JuiceFS mount read/write, but its S3
  `ListObjects` behavior is not fully ordered. Avoid relying on JuiceFS
  maintenance commands that need complete ordered object listing, especially
  `gc`, `fsck`, `sync`, and `destroy`, unless separately tested for this R2
  bucket and accepted for the operation.

## llm-access Request-Path Valkey Cache

- The request-path Valkey cache is separate from JuiceFS metadata. It only
  caches hot Postgres control-plane reads used during bearer auth, route
  snapshot loading, runtime-config reads, Codex status snapshot reads,
  account-view selection, and selected-account auth hydration.
- Local private request-cache config lives in `.local/common/valkey/lb7666.env`
  and must stay ignored by git with mode `0600`. Source it explicitly when
  testing from this workstation:
  ```bash
  set -a
  source .local/common/valkey/lb7666.env
  set +a
  ```
- The shared env var name for the Valkey URL is
  `LLM_ACCESS_REQUEST_CACHE_URL`. The live GCP `/etc/llm-access/llm-access.env`
  should export that variable for both `llm-access.service` and
  `llm-access-usage-worker.service`.
- When the cloud `llm-access` API or usage worker uses Postgres control-plane
  state, start them with:
  - `--request-cache-url-env LLM_ACCESS_REQUEST_CACHE_URL`
  - `--request-cache-key-prefix llma`
- The request-cache key prefix must stay stable across all nodes that should
  share the same cache namespace. Changing the prefix intentionally cold-starts
  the cache.
- Postgres remains the only durable source of truth. Valkey cache loss, TTL
  expiry, or entry invalidation must never lose quota/account state.
- Cache freshness is maintained by explicit invalidation and generation bumps on
  key, group, proxy, runtime-config, auth-refresh, and account-state writes.
  TTL only bounds stale leftovers and memory growth; it is not the freshness
  mechanism.
- The request path is intentionally resilient to cache failures. If Valkey is
  unavailable or an entry decode fails, `llm-access` falls back to the current
  Postgres query path and logs a warning instead of rejecting user traffic.
- Current TTL policy uses deterministic jitter around multi-hour base TTLs to
  avoid synchronized expiry bursts. Do not replace that with identical fixed
  TTL values for all keys.

## Cloud llm-access Deployment Shape

- `llm-access` must keep a single active writer for its auth JSON files, local
  journal files, and mutable DuckDB state. Do not run local and cloud
  `llm-access` processes that both write the same JuiceFS-mounted state tree or
  the same VM-local usage state.
- Production `llm-access` now uses Neon Postgres as the live control plane.
  The shared connection file lives at `/mnt/llm-access/config/neon.env`. The
  older `/mnt/llm-access/control/llm-access.sqlite3` file is retained only as a
  rollback snapshot and must not be treated as the live source of truth.
- The production deployment uses two JuiceFS mount points:
  - control/state mount: `/mnt/llm-access`
  - usage analytics mount: `/mnt/llm-access-usage`
- llm-access should use:
  - API state root: `/mnt/llm-access`
  - shared Neon config: `/mnt/llm-access/config/neon.env`
  - rollback SQLite snapshot: `/mnt/llm-access/control/llm-access.sqlite3`
  - hot local usage journal dir: `/var/lib/staticflow/llm-access/usage-journal`
  - local active DuckDB dir: `/var/lib/staticflow/llm-access/analytics-active`
  - archived immutable DuckDB segments:
    `/mnt/llm-access-usage/analytics/segments`
  - DuckDB segment catalog: `/mnt/llm-access-usage/analytics/catalog`
  - packed per-event heavy usage details:
    `/mnt/llm-access-usage/details/packs/<provider>/<yyyy>/<mm>/<dd>/...`
  - email credentials: `/mnt/llm-access/config/email_accounts.json`
  - API bind address: `127.0.0.1:19080`
  - usage worker bind address: `127.0.0.1:19081`
- `usage-journal` is VM-local only. The active path is
  `/var/lib/staticflow/llm-access/usage-journal`. Do not recreate
  `/mnt/llm-access/usage-journal`; if that directory appears again, treat it as
  stale dead data and remove it.
- Gmail notification credentials must live on JuiceFS, not VM-local `/etc`.
  `llm-access.service` should set
  `EMAIL_ACCOUNTS_FILE=/mnt/llm-access/config/email_accounts.json`; keep the
  file mode `0600` and do not log credential contents.
- Service ownership after the Neon cutover:
  - `llm-access.service`: provider traffic, Neon control reads/writes, account
    status refreshers, and compact local usage journal production.
  - `llm-access-usage-worker.service`: runtime-config reads from Neon, journal
    consumption, tiered DuckDB summary writes, packed usage-detail writes,
    worker progress state, and legacy admin/public usage query routes on the
    worker port.
- Live GCP `llm-access.service` and `llm-access-usage-worker.service` currently
  run as the non-root `ts_user` service user. The critical requirement is not
  the username; it is that the same service user can read the shared JuiceFS
  config, the local journal directory, and both FUSE mounts consistently.
- Current GCP systemd units verified on 2026-05-16:
  - `juicefs-llm-access.service`: mounts `/mnt/llm-access`
  - `juicefs-llm-access-usage.service`: mounts `/mnt/llm-access-usage`
  - `llm-access.service`: serves `127.0.0.1:19080`, sources
    `/mnt/llm-access/config/neon.env`, and starts with
    `--postgres-control-database-url-env LLM_ACCESS_CONTROL_DATABASE_URL`
  - `llm-access-usage-worker.service`: serves `127.0.0.1:19081`, sources the
    same Neon env, consumes the local journal root, and writes usage artifacts
    under `/mnt/llm-access-usage`
  - `pb-mapper-server-cli@llm-access.service`: registers cloud
    `127.0.0.1:19080` as pb-mapper key `llm-access`
- Current GCP llm-access logs:
  - systemd journal: `sudo journalctl -u llm-access.service -f`
  - usage worker journal:
    `sudo journalctl -u llm-access-usage-worker.service -f`
  - runtime app logs:
    `/var/log/staticflow-runtime/llm-access/app/current.*.log`
  - runtime access logs:
    `/var/log/staticflow-runtime/llm-access/access/current.*.log`
  - JuiceFS mount logs:
    `sudo journalctl -u juicefs-llm-access.service -f`
    and `sudo journalctl -u juicefs-llm-access-usage.service -f`
  Runtime logs rotate hourly and retain the latest 4 files per stream.
- Background provider status refresh should stay enabled on
  `llm-access.service` during normal production operation. Do not pin
  `LLM_ACCESS_BACKGROUND_STATUS_REFRESH_ENABLED=0` in the service unit unless
  you are intentionally pausing periodic Codex/Kiro account-status refresh for
  incident mitigation.
- Multi-node `llm-access` version one uses two deployment classes:
  - `core`: exactly one node, mounts `/mnt/llm-access` and
    `/mnt/llm-access-usage`, publishes itself as the primary through shared
    Valkey metadata, runs background refresh, and owns DuckDB/JuiceFS usage
    writes.
  - `edge`: zero or more nodes, no JuiceFS mount, still serve API traffic and
    write local journals, but their local usage worker only proxies usage
    queries to the primary worker and relays sealed journal files to it.
- Multi-node identity is configured through:
  - `LLM_ACCESS_NODE_ID`
  - `LLM_ACCESS_NODE_CLASS` (`core` or `edge`)
  - optional `LLM_ACCESS_NODE_DISPLAY_NAME`
  - optional `LLM_ACCESS_NODE_REGION`
  - optional `LLM_ACCESS_NODE_API_BASE_URL`
  - optional `LLM_ACCESS_NODE_WORKER_BASE_URL`
  These node-role features require the shared request-cache Valkey config to be
  present, because version one publishes primary and node snapshots in the
  existing `llma:*` namespace.
- Version one does not support multiple live `core` nodes. Do not deploy a
  second `core` node until the cluster-truth and failover design is upgraded.
- The service-level background refresher is separate from the per-account
  Codex "auto refresh" toggle in admin. The per-account toggle only controls
  whether that account may use its `refresh_token` to renew auth when needed;
  it does not replace the global periodic refresher.
- Current GCP JuiceFS local cache uses:
  - control mount cache: `/var/cache/juicefs/llm-access`
  - usage mount cache: `/var/cache/juicefs/llm-access-usage`
  Keep both caches on VM-local ext4 storage, not inside the FUSE mount.

## GCP Memory Guard (2c8g VM)

- `/swapfile` and `/swapfile-llm-extra` are each 2 GiB emergency swap files,
  enabled through `/etc/fstab`; host swap total is 4 GiB.
- `/etc/sysctl.d/99-staticflow-memory-guard.conf` sets `vm.swappiness=10`.
- `llm-access.service` has `MemoryHigh=3584M`, `MemoryMax=4096M`,
  `MemorySwapMax=1024M`, `TasksMax=256`, and `OOMPolicy=kill`.
- `llm-access-usage-worker.service` should carry the DuckDB memory budget after
  the split. Start with `MemoryHigh=2200M`, `MemoryMax=3072M`,
  `MemorySwapMax=1024M`, `TasksMax=128`, and `OOMPolicy=kill`; keep API and
  worker limits independent so a DuckDB scan cannot kill provider traffic.
- `juicefs-llm-access.service` has `MemoryHigh=1800M`,
  `MemoryMax=2560M`, `MemorySwapMax=0`, `TasksMax=256`, and
  `OOMPolicy=kill`.
These limits are meant to kill/restart the offending service before the whole
VM becomes unreachable. Do not raise `MemoryMax` casually on 8 GiB RAM; keep
extra swap as an emergency buffer, not as normal working memory.

## llm-access Usage Analytics

- Current llm-access usage analytics should run in tiered DuckDB mode: only the
  active mutable DuckDB file lives on local VM block storage; JuiceFS/R2 stores
  immutable archived segment files plus the low-frequency segment catalog. Do
  not point a live writer at `/mnt/llm-access/analytics/usage.duckdb` as a
  mutable all-history DuckDB file.
- Heavy per-event detail payloads are not part of the hot DuckDB write path
  anymore. The worker writes summary facts into tiered DuckDB, but writes
  detail payloads as packed files under `/mnt/llm-access-usage/details`. This
  keeps checkpoint/rollover memory bounded by summary analytics instead of full
  request bodies, without maintaining a second direct-R2 upload path in the
  application.
- The API process no longer writes usage events directly into DuckDB. It first
  commits control-plane rollups through the live control repository, then
  appends compact diagnostic usage events to
  `/var/lib/staticflow/llm-access/usage-journal`. The separate usage worker
  consumes sealed journal files in batches, imports them into tiered DuckDB,
  records worker progress in `consumer-state.sqlite3`, and deletes consumed
  journal files.
- Journal file rollover is controlled by both size and age. Retention is
  intentionally lossy for old unconsumed diagnostics: control-plane rollups in
  the live repository remain the source of truth for quota/account accounting,
  while journal events are for detailed troubleshooting.
- Legacy usage query paths remain compatible. The public/API service keeps the
  old `/admin/llm-gateway/usage*` and `/admin/kiro-gateway/usage*` routes for
  auth and compatibility, but proxies those queries to
  `usage_query_base_url` (`http://127.0.0.1:19081` by default).
- The completed migration model is:
  1. Production `llm-access` state lives under `/mnt/llm-access` and the local
     VM active DuckDB directory described above.
  2. Only cloud `llm-access.service` writes live control rows and local journal
     files; only `llm-access-usage-worker.service` writes tiered DuckDB.
  3. Cloud Caddy owns the public LLM route split and sends LLM paths directly
     to `127.0.0.1:19080`.
  4. Local StaticFlow reaches cloud `llm-access` through the local
     `127.0.0.1:19182` pb-mapper subscription or through the public same-origin
     path; it must not mount/write the JuiceFS state directly.

## llm-access Startup and Sandboxing Constraints

- Startup must be gated on the JuiceFS mount and expected state files. If
  `llm-access` starts before `/mnt/llm-access` is really mounted, it can
  initialize an empty local directory and make production state appear missing.
  The GCP service should install `/usr/local/bin/staticflow-wait-llm-access-state`
  and run it as `ExecStartPre` for `llm-access.service`; if JuiceFS is managed
  as a plain `.service`, add an `ExecStartPost` mountpoint gate there too so
  systemd does not mark the mount ready before FUSE has actually attached.
- Do not use systemd path sandboxing directives such as `ProtectSystem=`,
  `ReadWritePaths=`, or `PrivateTmp=` on the GCP `llm-access.service` while
  `/mnt/llm-access` is a JuiceFS FUSE mount with `default_permissions`. This
  combination can fail before the service starts with
  `status=226/NAMESPACE` and `Failed to set up mount namespacing:
  /mnt/llm-access: Permission denied`. Rely on the non-root service user,
  directory ownership, and the readiness script instead.

## llm-access Admin API Constraints

- Admin usage APIs are compatibility proxies to the usage worker. Broad
  diagnostics should still avoid large pages or full-table scans: DuckDB scan
  buffers now affect `llm-access-usage-worker.service` rather than provider
  traffic, but the worker is still a production process. Online usage list
  endpoints must stay server-bounded and lightweight: max `limit` is 20, max
  `offset` is 200, and list responses must not read/return heavy diagnostic
  fields such as message content or routing diagnostics. The response `total`
  should still be the exact count for the active filter condition, including
  key/provider/time filters. Use the per-event detail endpoint by `event_id`
  when heavy fields are needed.

## Current Runtime Verification Snapshot

- Verified on GCP at `2026-05-16T22:13:00Z`.
- Effective live API unit:
  - service user: `ts_user`
  - bind: `127.0.0.1:19080`
  - current `ExecStart`: API process with
    `--postgres-control-database-url-env LLM_ACCESS_CONTROL_DATABASE_URL`
    and `--usage-journal-dir /var/lib/staticflow/llm-access/usage-journal`
  - `/proc/<api-pid>/environ` contains
    `LLM_ACCESS_CONTROL_DATABASE_URL=<redacted>`
- Effective live usage-worker unit:
  - service user: `ts_user`
  - bind: `127.0.0.1:19081`
  - current `ExecStart`: worker process with the same Postgres control env,
    local journal root, local active DuckDB dir, dedicated JuiceFS usage
    archive/catalog dirs, and JuiceFS-packed usage details
  - cgroup guard observed live:
    `MemoryHigh=2200M`, `MemoryMax=3072M`, `MemorySwapMax=1024M`
- Live health checks that should all pass:
  ```bash
  curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:19080/healthz
  curl -fsS https://ackingliu.top/api/llm-gateway/status
  curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:19081/admin/llm-access/usage-worker/status
  findmnt -T /mnt/llm-access
  findmnt -T /mnt/llm-access-usage
  systemctl cat llm-access.service llm-access-usage-worker.service
  ps -o pid,args= -C llm-access -C llm-access-usage-worker
  tr '\0' '\n' </proc/$(systemctl show -p MainPID --value llm-access.service)/environ | grep '^LLM_ACCESS_CONTROL_DATABASE_URL='
  tr '\0' '\n' </proc/$(systemctl show -p MainPID --value llm-access-usage-worker.service)/environ | grep '^LLM_ACCESS_CONTROL_DATABASE_URL='
  ```
- Healthy interpretation:
  - API args must include `--postgres-control-database-url-env`.
  - worker args must include both `--postgres-control-database-url-env` and
    `--usage-journal-dir /var/lib/staticflow/llm-access/usage-journal`.
  - `worker.state == idle` with `last_error == null` and a local journal root
    means the worker is healthy even if there are no sealed files pending.
  - `llm_access_owner` should appear in Neon `pg_stat_activity` when the API
    and worker are live.

## Known Residuals After Neon Control Cutover

- `/mnt/llm-access/control/llm-access.sqlite3` is retained only as a rollback
  snapshot. It is no longer a live truth source.
- `/mnt/llm-access/usage-journal` was removed on 2026-05-16. If it reappears,
  treat it as stale wrong-path data and delete it after confirming no process
  has it open.
- `/mnt/llm-access/analytics` is legacy. Current worker archive/catalog/detail
  writes belong under `/mnt/llm-access-usage`, not the old control mount.

## Cloud Release and Post-Release Verification

- Keep a local ignored copy of the shared Neon control config at
  `.local/llm-access-neon.env`. It must define
  `LLM_ACCESS_CONTROL_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...`.
- `prepare_llm_access_cloud_release.sh` now treats that local file as the
  release source of truth, uploads it into the staged bundle, and
  `activate_llm_access_cloud_release.sh` installs it back onto the live JuiceFS
  path `/mnt/llm-access/config/neon.env` before restarting API/worker.
- Local release preparation from this checkout:
  ```bash
  export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/mnt/wsl/data4tb/static-flow-data/cargo-target/static_flow
  ./scripts/prepare_llm_access_cloud_release.sh
  ```
- Remote activation:
  ```bash
  set -a
  source .local/llm-access-cloud-release.env
  set +a
  ssh -i "$GCP_SSH_KEY" -o IdentitiesOnly=yes "$GCP_DEST" \
    '/home/ts_user/staticflow-llm-access-release/activate_llm_access_cloud_release.sh'
  ```
- Required post-release checks:
  ```bash
  curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:19080/healthz
  curl -fsS https://ackingliu.top/api/llm-gateway/status
  curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:19081/admin/llm-access/usage-worker/status
  findmnt -T /mnt/llm-access
  findmnt -T /mnt/llm-access-usage
  systemctl cat llm-access.service llm-access-usage-worker.service
  ps -o pid,args= -C llm-access -C llm-access-usage-worker
  tr '\0' '\n' </proc/$(systemctl show -p MainPID --value llm-access.service)/environ | grep '^LLM_ACCESS_CONTROL_DATABASE_URL='
  tr '\0' '\n' </proc/$(systemctl show -p MainPID --value llm-access-usage-worker.service)/environ | grep '^LLM_ACCESS_CONTROL_DATABASE_URL='
  sudo journalctl -u llm-access.service -n 80 --no-pager -l
  sudo journalctl -u llm-access-usage-worker.service -n 80 --no-pager -l
  ```
- If API args still show `--sqlite-control`, or the Neon env is missing from
  `/proc/<pid>/environ`, inspect stale drop-ins and activation drift first:
  - `/etc/systemd/system/llm-access.service.d/readiness.conf`
  - `/etc/systemd/system/llm-access.service.d/tiered-duckdb.conf`
  - `/etc/systemd/system/llm-access.service.d/zz-usage-journal-split.conf`
- If the worker returns permission errors for `.../usage-journal/sealed`, check
  owner/group of `/var/lib/staticflow/llm-access/usage-journal` and confirm the
  local path still exists on ext4 rather than JuiceFS.
- If the worker starts but usage queries return empty unexpectedly, verify the
  worker is mounted on `/mnt/llm-access-usage`, and confirm its effective
  `LLM_ACCESS_STATE_ROOT`, `LLM_ACCESS_DUCKDB_ARCHIVE_DIR`,
  `LLM_ACCESS_DUCKDB_CATALOG_DIR`, and `LLM_ACCESS_USAGE_DETAILS_DIR`.

## Historical Incident Lesson: Usage Mount Restart Can Break API SQLite Handles

- During the early 2026-05-16 worker-only usage-storage rollout, before the
  Neon control cutover, a broken `juicefs-llm-access-usage.service` revision
  effectively controlled the main `/mnt/llm-access` mount instead of the
  dedicated `/mnt/llm-access-usage` mount. Restarting that unit transiently
  disrupted the control/state JuiceFS mount used by `llm-access.service`.
- The outage symptom was subtle: `llm-access.service` stayed `active/running`,
  `GET /healthz` and `GET /version` still worked, but endpoints that touched
  the SQLite control store such as `/api/llm-gateway/access` and
  `/api/llm-gateway/status` hung or timed out.
- The old usage analytics tree deletion under `/mnt/llm-access/analytics` was
  not the cause. The real failure mode was stale open SQLite file descriptors
  after the control mount bounced. On the affected process, `lsof -p <pid>`
  showed `/mnt/llm-access/control/llm-access.sqlite3` and WAL files as
  `Transport endpoint is not connected`.
- Fast triage sequence:
  ```bash
  findmnt -T /mnt/llm-access
  findmnt -T /mnt/llm-access-usage
  systemctl status juicefs-llm-access.service juicefs-llm-access-usage.service --no-pager
  curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:19080/healthz
  curl -m 10 -fsS http://127.0.0.1:19080/api/llm-gateway/status
  sudo lsof -p "$(systemctl show -p MainPID --value llm-access.service)" | grep llm-access.sqlite3
  ```
- Recovery rule: if the mount has already recovered but `lsof` still shows
  stale SQLite descriptors, restart `llm-access.service`. Do not waste time
  debugging the API binary first; it needs to reopen SQLite on the restored
  FUSE mount.
- This exact stale-SQLite-fd symptom applied before the Neon cutover, but the
  mount-isolation prevention rules remain valid.

## Incident Lesson: Shared Neon Env Must Be Sourced Inside the Service Shell

- The shared control config now lives at `/mnt/llm-access/config/neon.env` on
  JuiceFS.
- Do not point a systemd `EnvironmentFile=` directly at that JuiceFS path and
  assume it behaves like a local ext4 file. With `default_permissions`,
  PID1/root-side file access and mount namespace behavior can differ from the
  `ts_user` service process that actually runs the binaries.
- Use `/usr/bin/bash -lc 'set -a; . /mnt/llm-access/config/neon.env; exec ...'`
  in both `ExecStartPre` and `ExecStart` so the same service user reads the
  same mounted file in the same namespace as the binary.
- Post-release verification must inspect both process args and
  `/proc/<pid>/environ`. A green `/healthz` alone does not prove the service is
  actually using Neon.

## Incident Lesson: Stale Drop-Ins Can Silently Keep API on SQLite

- Older `/etc/systemd/system/llm-access.service.d/*.conf` files can override a
  newly installed base unit `ExecStart` or `ExecStartPre`, even after a fresh
  release bundle is activated.
- The concrete stale files observed during the 2026-05-16 Neon cutover were:
  - `/etc/systemd/system/llm-access.service.d/readiness.conf`
  - `/etc/systemd/system/llm-access.service.d/tiered-duckdb.conf`
  - `/etc/systemd/system/llm-access.service.d/zz-usage-journal-split.conf`
- Activation must remove those stale drop-ins, run `systemctl daemon-reload`,
  and then verify `systemctl cat llm-access.service` plus
  `ps -o pid,args= -C llm-access`.
- A passing `/healthz` is not enough. The API can look healthy while still
  running the wrong storage backend if an old drop-in preserved the old
  `ExecStart`.

## Emergency Recovery for Sudden Public Outage

Common trigger pattern: home network flap, ISP reconnect, hotspot fallback,
or other local-to-cloud path churn causes pb-mapper data forwarding to wedge
while systemd units still look "active".

Another trigger pattern is downstream relay latency on non-LLM routes that is
much higher than StaticFlow's own route timings. Treat that as a likely stale
or wedged cloud-side Caddy/pb-mapper connection state before changing
StaticFlow backend code. For Codex/Kiro/NewAPI LLM latency, check cloud
`llm-access.service` and its DuckDB/JuiceFS state first; that path no longer
traverses the local `sf-backend` pb-mapper tunnel.

If cloud-side `pb-mapper-client` reports
`Not valid key:sf-backend,valid keys:[...]`, or cloud-side
`pb-mapper-server` reports
`subcribe server conn key not exist, key:sf-backend`, or
`127.0.0.1:39080` never comes back to `LISTEN`, then the home/local machine
likely has not re-registered the `sf-backend` service. In that case, prompt
the user to re-register/restart the local home-side pb-mapper service first,
rather than repeatedly restarting only cloud-side services.

First-line recovery for these cloud relay path issues is to restart the
cloud-side Caddy and pb-mapper services together. This drops stale HTTP
keepalive/HTTP2/tunnel connections and is often the fastest way to restore
normal downstream latency:

```bash
set -a
source .local/llm-access-cloud-release.env
set +a
ssh -i "$GCP_SSH_KEY" -o IdentitiesOnly=yes "$GCP_DEST"
sudo systemctl restart caddy
sudo systemctl restart pb-mapper-server.service
sudo systemctl restart pb-mapper-client-cli@sf-backend.service
```

After restart, verify both the relay path and public path:

```bash
set -a
source .local/llm-access-cloud-release.env
set +a
ssh -i "$GCP_SSH_KEY" -o IdentitiesOnly=yes "$GCP_DEST" \
  "curl -o /dev/null -sS -w 'code=%{http_code} size=%{size_download} start=%{time_starttransfer} total=%{time_total}\n' \
    -H 'Host: ackingliu.top' http://127.0.0.1:39080/"

env -u https_proxy -u HTTPS_PROXY -u http_proxy -u HTTP_PROXY -u all_proxy -u ALL_PROXY \
  curl -o /dev/null -sS -w 'code=%{http_code} size=%{size_download} start=%{time_starttransfer} total=%{time_total}\n' \
  https://ackingliu.top/
```

If `sf-backend` was missing and has just been re-registered on the
home/local machine, restart cloud-side
`pb-mapper-client-cli@sf-backend.service` once more so it can re-subscribe to
the now-valid key.

If cloud-side restart does not restore service, continue debugging on the
home/local machine side of the tunnel before changing Caddy config.
